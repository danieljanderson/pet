# pet
A user can interact with my programs in one of two ways: command line or through the web app.
to be able to interact with pet.js through the command line you will need to install node.  
The command line will then ask you what name you want to call your pet.
your pet has three attributes: food, energy, or happiness
After you name the pet you can either play with it, feed it, let it sleep, leave for the day,come home. You can even battle the computer.
If you choose to do the battle option, the computer will generate a new pet object.  It will then generate random values for the attributes.
It will then add all the values together for the your pet object and the computer pet object.  If your sum is greater than the computer than you will win.
If not you will lose.
Depending on which one you choose your pet will increase or decrease food, energy, happiness.
The pet also has a power level. The pet starts out with a power level of 0.  If your food, energy, and happiness gets to 10 your
power level becomes 1.  Your power level becomes 2 when your food , energy, and happiness hit the number 20.  Your power level
becomes 3 when your food,energy, and happiness hit 40.  the level becomes 4 when your attributes hit 60.  Lastly it your power level hits 5 
when your attributes hit 100.

To interact with the pet object on the web just follow this link https://danieljanderson.github.io/pet/.
